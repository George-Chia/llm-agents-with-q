This transcontinental collisional event occurred during the  Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period).[1] The Wyoming sector of the Colorado orogeny was formerly called the Medicine Bow orogeny. The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny. The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone that verges northward. The Cheyenne belt transects and cuts off the south edge of the older Trans-Hudson orogeny.[2]"

In 2016, it received a Best Compilation Album nomination by the Independent Music Awards. All tracks were recorded at Tarquin's Jungle Room Studios in New Paltz (village), New York. Being moved by the lack of support for returning veterans through his life Tarquin decided to compose a heavy instrumental rock album as a way to show his appreciation to all veterans. So once again he enlisted top notch players to guest with him on the album, Billy Sheehan on Black Hawk, Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal and Reb Beach on Taliban Terror, Steve Morse on Freedom, Chris Poland on Charlie Surfs and Hunting, Chuck Loeb on Escape Kabul, Hal Lindes on Sand & Blood, Gary Hoey on 5 Klicks To Hell and Baghdad, Alex De Rosso Dokken on Broken Arrow, and The Flyin' Ryan Brothers on Surgical Strike.  The entire album was engineered, produced and composed by Tarquin especially for each one of the guest guitarists. Partial proceeds are donated to the Fisher House Foundation from sales."
